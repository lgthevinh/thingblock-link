//! Coverage for the hardware-free part of `upload`: the WS-payload → gRPC
//! `UploadRequest` mapping (port construction, `import_file`, and the optional
//! `upload.speed` override). The streamed gRPC translation needs a live daemon and
//! a real board, so it is exercised by manual end-to-end runs rather than here
//! (the same boundary `compile` draws).
