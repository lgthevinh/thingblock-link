//! Generated `ArduinoCoreService` client and the thin wrapper the rest of the
//! helper talks to.
//!
//! `build.rs` runs `protox` over the vendored protos in `proto/` and feeds the
//! descriptor set to tonic, which emits one nested module tree (`mod.rs`) into
//! `OUT_DIR`. [`pb`] re-exports it; [`cli`] is the convenient alias for the
//! `cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1` package.
//!
//! Per-RPC helper methods (`board_list`, `compile`, …) that translate to the
//! helper's shapes land on [`Client`] via one submodule per RPC (each a separate
//! `impl Client` block, e.g. [`board`]); the arduino-cli schema never leaks past
//! this module.
