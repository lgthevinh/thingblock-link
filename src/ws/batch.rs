//! Outbound coalescing for the writer task. A fast serial device or a chatty
//! compiler streams many tiny `monitorData` / `log` chunks; sending one WS frame
//! each is wasteful on both ends. The writer buffers these streamed-text chunks
//! over a short window (see `BATCH_COOLDOWN` in `session.rs`) and merges
//! consecutive same-`id` chunks into one frame. The wire envelope is unchanged —
//! a payload just carries a longer concatenated string — so chunk boundaries
//! within a stream are not significant to the editor.
//!
//! Only `log` / `monitorData` are batched; terminal (`result`/`error`), `progress`
//! and `event` messages bypass the buffer and are sent promptly.
